Media upload components
WhatsApp does not guarantee that data (such as images, videos, or documents) shared with you by your customers is non-malicious. Make sure to implement appropriate risk mitigations when processing such data (for example, using well-tested and up-to-date media and document processing libraries).

Media upload components are not supported by the On-Premise API client. Please refer to the deprecation announcent and learn how to migrate to Cloud API.

Flow JSON components
Two components can be used to ask users to upload media

PhotoPicker: allows uploading media from camera or gallery
DocumentPicker: allows uploading media from files or gallery
PhotoPicker

Handling media
Endpoint
Media uploaded by the users are temporarily (up to 20 days) stored in WhatsApp CDN. Files are encrypted using AES256-CBC+HMAC-SHA256+pkcs7 cryptographic algorithms.

In your endpoint implementation, you must download, decrypt, and validate each media file.

Here’s a payload example for a photo or document.

"photo_picker":[{
     "media_id": "790aba14-5f4a-4dbd-aa9e-0d75401da14b",
     "cdn_url": "https://mmg.whatsapp.net/v/redacted",
     "file_name": "IMG_5237.jpg"
     "encryption_metadata": {
       "encrypted_hash": "/QvkBvpBED2q2AHPIFuhXfLpkn22zj2kO6ggzjvhHv0=",
       "iv": "5SHjLrrsfPXTSJTcbrVSkg==",
       "encryption_key": "lPa4SXcWbk3sy2so3OxjyXmpV4aE6CcIKd+4byr5hBw=",
       "hmac_key": "15l+E9Z5gcL15WH9OQ8GgK7VVCKkfbVigoSiM9djvGU=",
       "plaintext_hash": "AOF2dHXVEpm9efk9udNy3R1cUJWnpjFwQKGBEdALqXI="
     }]
    
Decrypting and validating media
The files stored in WhatsApp CDN contain the encrypted media and the first 10 bytes of the HMAC-SHA256 (concatenated at the end). For reference, cdn_file = ciphertext & hmac10

Perform the following steps to decrypt the media:
Download cdn_file file from cdn_url
Make sure SHA256(cdn_file) == enc_hash
Validate HMAC-SHA256
Calculate HMAC with hmac_key, initialization vector (encryption_metadata.iv) and ciphertex
Make sure first 10 bytes == hmac10
Decrypt media content
Run AES with CBC mode and initialization vector (encryption_metadata.iv) on ciphertex
Remove padding (AES256 uses blocks of 16 bytes, padding algorithm is pkcs7). We’ll call this decrypted_media
Validate the decrypted media
Make sure SHA256(decrypted_media) = plaintext_hash
Response message (Cloud API)
Media can be received in the response message webhook.

Here’s a truncated example using PhotoPicker (same structure for DocumentPicker)

{
    "nfm_reply": {
        // [... redacted ... ]
        "response_json": {
            "photo_picker": [
                {
                    "file_name": "IMG_5237.jpg",
                    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "sha256": "PqHgadp8cJ/N6mvAYGNMxhs9Ra5hbZFcctCtCClXsMU=",
